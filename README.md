# Chromoselector

These are the archives for Chromoselector, a jQuery color picker plugin.

I developed this color picker plugin while in college and sold it on Code Canyon for a few years. With the emergence of new frameworks, the saves of jQuery plugins took a dive and I decided to pull it from the marketplace.

Now making the plugin available on GitHub, grab a copy from the ```releses``` folder.
